# SVJedi-graph : long-read SV genotyper with variant graph

SVJedi-graph constructs a variation graph to represent a set of SVs from a VCF file, which is then used as a base to map long reads on with GraphAligner [^1]. Currently works best with GraphAligner v1.0.12 (https://github.com/maickrau/GraphAligner/releases/tag/v1.0.12).
